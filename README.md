# Fetch Data Project

This is a very simple project made for the MITxPRO course. There is still a lot of work to be done, and I am not happy with the current state of it. Its intention is to be able to search a database of baseball players, but I'm not sure how to link a full database (such as baseball-reference) to the file. This is the current state of the project. Hopefully I will be able to delve deeper into the code and figure all this stuff out.
